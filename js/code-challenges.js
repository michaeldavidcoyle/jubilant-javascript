// Write a function that returns the SUM of a sequence of numbers. This sequence is determined
// by three variables: start, finish, and step. The sequence begins at start, ends at finish,
// and goes up by step until it reaches finish or a number that when increased by step would
// go past finish.
// Examples:
// Input: start: 1 finish: 4 step: 1 | Output: 10
// Input: start: 4 finish: 10 step: 5 | Output: 13

function sumSequence(start, finish, step) {
    let sequence = [];

    for (let i = start; i <= finish; i += step) {
        sequence.push(i);
    }

    return sequence.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}

let start = 1;
let finish = 4;
let step = 1;

console.log(`start: ${start}, finish: ${finish}, step: ${step}
sum: ${sumSequence(start, finish, step)}`);
